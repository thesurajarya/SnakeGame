This classic **Snake Game** using pure Java and a bit of Swing magic 🧙‍♂️💻.

You control a funky green snake 🐍 slithering around the screen, gobbling up juicy red apples 🍎 like it’s starving after a long day. Every time you eat an apple, you grow longer — but don’t get too greedy or you’ll crash into yourself like a noob 😂💥.

**🎮 Controls?** Arrow keys,⬅️⬆️⬇️➡️
**🎯 Goal?** Eat. Grow. Survive. Repeat.

Features:

* 💚 Snake that actually moves (yes, it works!)
* 🍏 Apples pop up randomly like magic
* 📈 Scoreboard to flex your skills
* ☠️ Instant death if you hit a wall or your own tail — tough love!
* 🖼️ Retro blocky visuals that hit you with nostalgia

Warning: It's dangerously addictive. You've been warned. 😜
